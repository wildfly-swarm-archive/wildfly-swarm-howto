## How to test in-container

Using *Arquillian*, we have the capability of injecting
unit tests into a running application.  This allows us
to peel back the covers and peek inside to ensure that
the correct things are occurring.

Arquillian has existed for quite a while, and WildFly Swarm
has simply created an adapter and some useful annotations to
make Arquillian-based testing work well with WildFly Swarm
applications.

### Dependencies

To use the WildFly Swarm Arquillian integrations, you first
include the WildFly BOM as described in <<../use-a-bom/index.adoc#,How to use a BOM>>,
and then reference the `org.wildfly.swarm:arquillian` artifact with
a `<scope>` of `test`:

[source,xml]
----
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
[snippet](pom.xml#bom)
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
----

[source,xml]
----
  <dependencies>
[snippet](pom.xml#arquillian)
  </dependencies>
----

### Write your Application

You construct your application like normal, including using
any default `project-defaults.yml` you need to configure bits of
it.

### Create a test

Creating an Arquillian test before WildFly Swarm generally involved
programatically creating `Archive` due to the fact that applications
were larger, and the desire was to test a single component in isolation.

In a world of microservices, this tends to not be the case, and the entire
"application" represents one small microservice component.

The `@DefaultDeployment` annotation has been provided to automatically
create the deployment of the entire application.

It it applied at the class level of your typical JUnit test, along
with the usual `@RunWith(Arquillian.class)` annotation:

[source,java]

[unsnippet](src/test/java/org/wildfly/swarm/howto/incontainer/InContainerTest.java#prolog)
----

Using the `@DefaultDeployment` annotation provided by WildFly Swarm's
Arquillian integration means you should *not* use the usual Arquillian
`@Deployment` annotation on a static method returning an `Archive`.

The `@DefaultDeployment` annotation looks at the package of the test:

[source,java]
----
[unsnippet](src/test/java/org/wildfly/swarm/howto/incontainer/InContainerTest.java#package)
----

From that package, it uses heuristics to include all of your other application classes
residing in that package or deeper within the Java packaging hierarchy.

While this allows for creating tests that only create a "default deployment" for sub-packages
of your application, it does also prevent you from placing tests in an unrelated
package, such as:

[source,java]
----
package org.mycorp.myapp.test;
----

Now, simply write your normal Arquillian-type of test, including using Arquillian
facilities to gain access to internal running components.

Here, we use Arquillian to inject the `InitialContext` of the running application
into an instance member of our test-case:

[source,java]
----
[unsnippet](src/test/java/org/wildfly/swarm/howto/incontainer/InContainerTest.java#arquillian-resource)
----

Then our test method itself can use that `InitialContext` in order to ensure
the datasource we configured using `project-defaults.yml` is actually live and
available:

[source,java]
----
[unsnippet](src/test/java/org/wildfly/swarm/howto/incontainer/InContainerTest.java#test)
----


### Run your test

Since Arquillian is simply an integration with JUnit, you can run your test
by using Maven or your IDE:

#### Using Maven

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn install
----

#### Using your IDE

In many IDEs, simply find your test-class, right-click and select `Run` to execute the
test.
